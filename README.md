1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CSS-Interactive-Experiments.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CSS-Interactive-Experiments
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to access the interactive experiments.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the layout for all experiments.
- `home.css`: Primary CSS file containing styling, animations, and transitions.
- `home.js`: JavaScript file handling interactivity and animations.

## Experiment Details

Each experiment is represented as a card on the main page. Clicking a card will take you to the experiment's dedicated page for further exploration.

- **Styling**: Each experiment is styled to showcase different CSS concepts, such as gradients, shadows, and hover effects.
- **Animations**: The CSS includes animations like `fadeIn`, `slideInLeft`, `slideInRight`, and `pulse` to add dynamic interactions.
- **JavaScript Enhancements**: JavaScript is used for delayed loading effects on each card, enhancing the user experience.

### Example Experiment

Hereâ€™s a snippet from the `home.css` file to illustrate the CSS used in these experiments:

```css
.experiment-card {
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, #3182ce, #63b3ed);
  color: white;
  border-radius: 20px;
  padding: 2.5rem;
  text-align: center;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease, opacity 0.3s ease;
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```
